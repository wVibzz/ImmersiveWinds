# ANNOUCNMENT
I am planning on adding a full on weather system, I'm talking dynamic rain clouds, weather events, hail, etc.

although this is a bit away, every new feature takes time, I am a solo dev and this is my first ever mod (thats right). So if you would like to contribute to Issues or to my main code please feel free to do so:

[Github Issues](https://github.com/wVibzz/ImmersiveWinds/issues)

[Github Main Code](https://github.com/wVibzz/ImmersiveWinds)

# Features:

- Dynamic Particle Movement: Experience particles such as smoke, flames, and even snowflakes react realistically to the wind's direction and intensity. Watch as smoke billows and snowflakes drift with the breeze, adding depth and atmosphere to your surroundings.
  
- Enhanced Weather Integration: Integrate wind effects seamlessly with existing weather systems. The more severe the weather, the higher the winds!

# Upcoming:

- ~~Combatibility with other particle mods~~ (DONE 0.6 UPDATE(MAY BE BUGS))
- ~~Better wind physics simulated around Walls and Caves.~~ (DONE (Need improvment))
- Custom wind wisps particles
- Custom Rain Particles that have direction and magnitude! (OHH YEAH!)
- Custom Snow Particles.
- This also means removing the dependency of particle rain!
  
- More to come! If you want to suggest a feature feel free to do so on my [Github Issues](https://github.com/wVibzz/ImmersiveWinds/issues)!

# Important:
### This mod is in Alpha and I am working on it (almost) everyday!
##
### **In the [Particle Rain](https://modrinth.com/mod/particle-rain) config lessen the spawn radius to improve performance, I recommend around 15 or less.**

Particle Rain is needed to disable the rendering of Vanilla Weather so that Immersive Winds can affect the Particle Rain and Snow to follow wind paterns.

- Compatibility: Some particle systems like [Biome Particle Weather](https://modrinth.com/mod/biome_particle_weather) may have unintended performance loss or weird particle movements that will not be correlated to Immersive Winds due to their own logic, please do try these mod out with Immersive Winds as it will still provide a better experience.

### Recomended Mods:
  [AAA Particles](https://modrinth.com/mod/aaa-particles), [Particle Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/particle-tweaks), [Particle Core](https://modrinth.com/mod/particle-core), [Drip Sounds (Fabric)](https://modrinth.com/mod/dripsounds-fabric).
